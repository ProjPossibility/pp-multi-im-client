# pp-multi-im-client
Overview

Hundreds of thousands of people use instant messenging with various IM clients everyday. Meebo.com is a website where one can login to their instant messenger account (AIM, Yahoo!, Google Talk, MSN, ICQ, and Jabber), instead of using the actual client. For our project, we wanted to make this website accessible to the blind or visually-impaired by using keyboard shortcuts and hotkeys. The technology we used to implement the same was AxsJax along with other software such as Greasemonkey,FireVox etc.

Future Plans
